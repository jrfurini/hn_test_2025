# Project Notes - House Numbers Challenge

## Context

- Fullstack challenge for House Numbers (Senior Full-Stack Engineer position)
- Backend: Node.js 20+ with TypeScript (NestJS, as simple as possible)
- Frontend: Modern JS framework (Remix preferred)
- Database: MongoDB
- AI: OpenAI (summarization)
- Tests: Jest (TDD)
- Docker: Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml in project root
- All documentation and code comments must be in English

## Decisions

- Using NestJS for backend due to developer experience, but keeping the structure minimal and simple
- docker-compose.yml and Dockerfile are in the project root for easier orchestration and visibility
- Project is now managed as a single-root project (not multi-root workspace) for better file visibility

## Next Steps

- Continue backend implementation (snippets endpoints, MongoDB integration, OpenAI integration)
- Create .env.example for environment variables
- Keep README and all docs in English
